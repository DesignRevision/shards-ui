## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you get started with Shards.

### üì¶ Download
Currently there are only two ways of downloading Shards:
* [Official Website](https://designrevision.com/download/shards)
* [Release Package](https://github.com/DesignRevision/shards-ui/releases)

### üñá Dependencies

The only hard dependency is Bootstrap 4 (final) which needs to be included in your HTML document before Shards. Datepickers and slider controls also require the Shards JavaScript dependency.

### üèéüí® Quick Start

In order to take advantage of both Bootstrap and Shards' features you may want to use the following starter template that includes all dependencies.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- CSS Dependencies -->

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/shards.min.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
